# meteor-technical-test


### Steps :
1. Find Bugs - Create a seperate file bugs.txt and write them there
2. Write Publications and Subscriptions ( You may want to remove autopublish)
3. Secure Autoforms - either with allow/deny or other approach
4. Write a seperate template to update a Task. The Task Secret can't be edited and must not be visible  or accessible to client. Client can update only name.
5. Implement accounts (login/signup). Package useraccounts:bootstrap/core are already added but not implemented.
6. Only logged in used should be able to access any other pages.
7. To get started- Fork the repo and once done send a pull request.
